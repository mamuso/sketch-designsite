# Export design projects to a Jekyll site

This project was part of a hack day we made at Yammer. The base of the plugin is coming from a [side project](https://github.com/mamuso/sketch-designdoc). The plugin exports a markdown file with a front matter for using with a Jekyll template.

The project exports all the artboards of the current page on your sketch document and pushes to a git repository without leaving Sketch.
